    <h2>Basic information</h2>
    
    <p>Eagles are large birds of prey with massive hooked bill and long broad wings.They belong to the family of <strong>Accipitridae</strong>.They are known for their keen sight and powerful <strong><em>soaring flight</em></strong>.Eagles belong to several groups of genera,some which are closely related.
      There are over <strong>60 species</strong> of eagles. Most of the  species of eagle are from Eurasia and Africa, and Outside this area,we have few species found in North America,Central and South America, and in Australia.It is bynamed the <em>king of birds</em>.</p>
      
    <p> As a result of is strength and uniqueness is often <strong>an emblem of powerful nations.</strong>There are four major groups of eagles: fish eagles, booted eagles, snake eagles and giant forest eagles.<strong> </p>
      
    <p>Harpy Eagles</strong> are the most powerful eagles in the world weighing 9 kgs (19.8 lbs.) with a wingspan measuring 2 meters (6.5 feet). Their wingspan is much shorter than other large birds because they need to maneuver in densely forested habitats.
 The largest eagle in the world is <em>Steller's Sea Eagle</em> (Haliaeetus pelagicus), which weighs 5-9 kg (11-20 lb) and has a wing-span of 2.2-2.45 m (7 ft 2 in-8 ft 0.3 in). Although it breeds mainly in Russia it has also been located in Korea and Japan.
The <strong>Philippine Eagle</strong> is considered the world's rarest bird of prey and the future survival of the species is in doubt,<strong><em>With fewer than 400 breeding pairs left in the wild</em></strong>.
